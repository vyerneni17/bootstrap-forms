# bootstrap-forms
Using bootstrap forms and bootstrap validation. <br>

The steps to replicate all functionality: 
1. The page loads with four input fields (and an image for wider screens).
2. Each field is validated dynamically while the user inputs.
3. After clicking on "Send" the first message on the button changes to "Sending..." and as it continues to take longer time 
a new message appears to let the user know it is still working on the submission
(To show this effect, setTimeout() function has been used to delay the actual functionality for a few seconds).
4. Once the form submission is complete, a success message appears on the page and the form fields are reset to default state.
5. This success message automatically disappears after few seconds.
